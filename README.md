## Description

This application allows users to create two Mad Libs of their choice. A mad lib is a short story where users enter a variety of different parts of speech (verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc) into blank parts of the story and receive a unique, strange, and sometimes hilarious story. Users are presented with a Home page where they can click on links to different Mad Libs. Then they are presented with a form where they can enter the words, and click a "Submit" button to read their Mad Lib on another page.
